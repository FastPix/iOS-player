 - Option to hide the SDKâ€™s default controls (`hideDefaultControls`) for building custom UI.  
 - Playlist state notifications via `NotificationCenter` (`FastPixPlaylistStateChanged`) for updating UI elements such as titles, buttons, or thumbnails.  
 - Built-in navigation methods: `next()`, `previous()`, and `jumpTo(index:)` for moving between items.  
 - Navigation methods can also be connected to custom UI buttons (e.g., Next/Previous/Episode selectors)
